This is a userscript for ViolentMoney/Greasemonkey/etc. to strip ads from boingboing.net.

BoingBoing was iconic and important in an earlier era of the internet.
But now it's a sad shell of its former self:
Cory Doctorow left;
The content quality is on an infinite downward slide;
And it's packed to the gills with awful ads for awful products masquerading as stories.
I know I should just let it go.
But I've never been good at letting things go.
So here's a userscript to strip out all the crap and make the user experience of BoingBoing's twilight bearable.
